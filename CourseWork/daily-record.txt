	What is sass and how to use it
	Definition: Sass (which stands for 'Syntactically awesome style sheets) is an extension of CSS that enables you to use things like variables, nested rules, inline imports and more. It also helps to keep things organised and allows you to create style sheets faster.
	Sass is compatible with all versions of CSS. The only requirement for using it is that you must have Ruby installed. Users are also asked to follow the Sass Community Guidelines.
	
	How to use it: SCSS (Sassy CSS): Uses the .scss file extension and is fully compliant with CSS syntax
	Indented (simply called 'Sass'): Uses .sass file extension and indentation rather than brackets; it is not fully compliant with CSS syntax, but it's quicker to write
	Note that files can be converted from one syntax to the other using the sass-convert command.

	What responsive design looks like
	In my opinion, I think when you design or create a page, you need to design it responsive in mobile first, then it make the page easier to design in destop.
